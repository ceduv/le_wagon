Searching one model (scope)
class Movie < ApplicationRecord
  # [...]
  include PgSearch::Model
  pg_search_scope :search_by_title_and_synopsis,
    against: [ :title, :synopsis ],
    using: {
      tsearch: { prefix: true } # <-- now `superman batm` will return something!
    }
end
# rails c
> Movie.search_by_title_and_synopsis("superman batm")
You can add weighting
to each field searched.

Searching through association
We want chris nolan to return Nolanâ€™s movies:

class Movie < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :director
  include PgSearch::Model
  pg_search_scope :global_search,
    against: [ :title, :synopsis ],
    associated_against: {
      director: [ :first_name, :last_name ]
    },
    using: {
      tsearch: { prefix: true }
    }
end
What about our tv_shows table ðŸ¤”
